From observing a player, they use the textbox like it was a chat box, expecting to "say" things.

then tried to issue commands with some english
Talk to X
Attack X

--- lots of typing
maybe add a targetting system
so that the player selects the target
then to commit to an attack all they have to type is "attack" + Enter

Or

attack enters "attack mode":
    pressing enter enacts a 'turn' of combat. there are some options available in a numbered list (or type the option name)
        1. SHOVE the <target> back
        2. ATTACK the <target> with your <weapon>
        3. RUN away from the <target>
        4. GRAPPLE the <target>
